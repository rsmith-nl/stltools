.Sh NAME
.Nm stl2pdf
.Nd Projects an STL file on the (x,y) plane after optionally rotating it and
renders a PDF figure of it. 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
infile
.Op Ar outfile
.Op x Ar degrees | y Ar degrees | z Ar degrees ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents version 
.Ql UkZTVkVS
of the 
.Nm
program. This program's purpose is to render a globally illuminated grayscale
projection of an STL file as PDF output.

First, the STL file is parsed. Both binary and text STL file can be read, but
any color information in binary STL files is discarded since this is not
standardized. While STL files are supposed to contain closed solids, by design
no effort is made to try and repair gaps in the STL file. There simply isn't
enough geometric context to do this in a foolproof way.

Next, all the triangles in the file are rotated around the axis of the global
coordinate system, as specified by the sequence of rotation options given on
the command line.

Finally, the visible triangles (visibility is determined by a non-negative
z-component of the unit normal vector of the triangle) are sorted by depth,
projected on the (x,y) plane. So in the PDF picture you are looking along the
z-axis to the origin. The picture is scaled to fit in a maximum size of
100x100 mm and the triangles are drawn from back to front. The grayscale tint
of the triangle is also determined by the orientation of the triangle; running
from almost black for triangles turned 90 degrees to the line of sight to near
white for triangles parallel to the x,y plane.

If no output filename is given, the path and the
.Ql .stl 
extension are stripped from the input filename. The extension is replaced by the
.Ql .pdf
extension. So if no output filename is specified, the output file is written
in the current working directory. The PDF file is written to the output
filename.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The following non-fatal warnings can be issued when the program cannot make
sense of command line arguments:
.Bl -tag -width "foo"
.It Unknown argument '...' ignored.
One of the command line transform arguments did not start with one of the
letters 'x', 'y', 'z', 'X', 'Y' or 'Z' and will be ignored. 
.It Argument '...' is not a number, ignored.
A non-numeric value was encountered among the command line arguments while a
number of degrees is expected as part of a rotation command. It will be ignored.
.El
.Pp
There are some errors which the program cannot ignore, and which will
terminate the program.
.Bl -tag -width "foo"
.It The file '...' cannot be read or parsed. Exiting.
If a given input file cannot be read, or if the file is not recognized as an
STL file, this error is produced, and the program is terminated with exit code
1.
.It Cannot write output file '...'.
An output file name was given on the command line, but the file in question
could not be opened for writing or written to. The program is terminated with
exit code 2.

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The 
.Nm
program requires the Python interpreter. It was written for version
2.7. Additionally, it requires the open source 
.Xr "Reportlab Toolkit" .

.Sh HISTORY
The origin of this software was found in the desire of the author to render 3D
CAD models using the POV-ray raytracer. The first effort produced the
.Xr stl2pov 1
program, written in C. 
.Pp
Later the author converted that program to Python as a learning
experience. This resulted in a more re-usable version of the software to parse
STL files as a Python module. Having done that, adding a front-end to produce
PostScript output was relatively easy.
.Pp
After descovering the
.Xr "Reportlab Toolkit"
module for producing PDF files with Python, the author discovered that it
would be relatively easy to modify
.Xr stl2ps
to use reportlab to produce PDF output directly.
